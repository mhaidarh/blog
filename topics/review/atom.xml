    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://www.pixar.com/sites/default/files/walle_billboards_v2_title_0.jpg">http://www.pixar.com/sites/default/files/walle_billboards_v2_title_0.jpg</a>" title="&lsquo;WALL-E Title&rsquo;" ></p>

<h1>The Intro</h1>

<p>WALL•E is a 3D animated sci-fi feature film by Disney Pixar, mainly tells about saving the world and a love story of robots. It&rsquo;s directed by Andrew Stanton, the man behind various Pixar films. Toy Story. A Bug&rsquo;s Life. Monsters, Inc. Finding Nemo. The Incredibles. Cars. Well, you name it.</p>

<p>Never watched it? Here&rsquo;s the official trailer. Already watched it? Watch it again anyway, it&rsquo;s fun. :)</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/alIq_wG9FNk "></iframe></div></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so interesting about this film? There&rsquo;re a lot actually.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://www.pixar.com/sites/default/files/walle_billboards_v2_world_v2_0.jpg">http://www.pixar.com/sites/default/files/walle_billboards_v2_world_v2_0.jpg</a>" title="&lsquo;WALL-E Space World&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>The World</h2>

<p>The world is set in the distant future, around 2805 A.D. when Earth is literally has a lot of mountains of trash. When the film goes through, the condition has three main states:</p>

<ol>
<li>Total dystopian future on Earth, even on Earth&rsquo;s Moon.</li>
<li>Kind of ironic utopian future in space (the Axiom)</li>
<li>Finally a normal future on Earth.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The (Main) Characters</h2>

<p>WALL•E (<strong>W</strong>aste <strong>A</strong>llocation <strong>L</strong>oad <strong>L</strong>ifter: <strong>E</strong>arth-Class). He&rsquo;s a wheeler-type robot and somehow has the personality or human-like way of thinking. Fueled by the sun and fun.</p>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://j.mp/1orIsIp">http://j.mp/1orIsIp</a>" title="&lsquo;WALL-E Picture&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>EVE (<strong>E</strong>xtraterrestrial <strong>V</strong>egetation <strong>E</strong>valuator). She&rsquo;s a hover probe droid-type robot. Subsequently along with WALL•E, she also has a personality. Sweet.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://j.mp/OO2jEN">http://j.mp/OO2jEN</a>" title="&lsquo;EVE Picture&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Both of these characters like resemble the Adam and Eve of the Pixar&rsquo;s Earth, if we can relate. Aside, there are a lot of various robots specifically built for a few purposes. Notice how the robots' appearance really kind of human-friendly than a real common robots. In this film, humans are just an extras, if we can say so.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://j.mp/Q4vMLX">http://j.mp/Q4vMLX</a>" title="&lsquo;Inside Axiom&rsquo;" ></p>

<h1>Interaction and Interface</h1>

<h2>Film World Context</h2>

<p>Summed up, here are what the main characters interact with, along with the specific interface if they have it:</p>

<ol>
<li>WALL•E with&hellip; his human-like senses. Well, the glitch in WALL•E made him think outside his box (<em>pun intended</em>). His main directive is to compact trash with his technologies: Construction, Regeneration Unit, Control System, and Trash Disposal.</li>
<li>EVE with her scanning sensor/device. Her point of view interface really has all the information she need. Her main directive is to get a vegetation (or plant) and bring it to Axiom so humans could get home (or Earth). She got modern technologies and also some additions: Investigator? Check. Maps? Check. Wait, plasma gun? Check.</li>
<li>Humans, mostly with their voice command. Their hover/floating chair also gives the capability to control devices and robots.</li>
</ol>


<p>In this film, everything in the robots is beyond artificial intelligence (AI). How, what they have?</p>

<ul>
<li>Specific gender and sound with half speaking ability.</li>
<li>Almost all machines are all automatically controlled and have their own free mind.</li>
<li>Although most of the robots are not humanoid, but have human-like personality.</li>
<li>So responsive and perfected ubiquoutus computing and ambient intelligence (AmI) inside them.</li>
<li>The robots could move smoothly, think, express, behave, sense, feel, and even love and understand it like human.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://j.mp/1eBBxsU">http://j.mp/1eBBxsU</a>" title="&lsquo;Axiom Passenger First Class&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Real World Context</h2>

<p>In the context of realistic Human-Computer Interaction, the film take it beyond and more than ordinary. Obviously&ndash;if we&rsquo;re being very realistic&ndash;that wouldn&rsquo;t really happened. In science fiction world, everything we can imagine about the interaction and interface would actually work well. Even so, we can imagine and relate the real world if we&rsquo;re going out of control of the technology, almost everything could go worse. But otherwise, everything could go better and humanity&ndash;or we&ndash;could still has the control of our own world.</p>

    <link href="http://mhaidarhanif.org/blog/metro-group-future-store-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-16T06:00:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://mhaidarhanif.org/blog/metro-group-future-store-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Innovation Background</h1>

<p>Innovative technology in human-computer interaction world has also come and rapidly changing on how people do business. One of the significant change is in technology shop, convenience store, or retail industry. That is, a huge chance in making huge change in order to develop it better and have the advantage of it.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://www.weiterleitung.metrogroup.de/metrogroup_logo.gif">http://www.weiterleitung.metrogroup.de/metrogroup_logo.gif</a>" title="&lsquo;METRO GROUP Logo&rsquo;" >
One of the most popular or viral concept and implementation is <a href="http://future-store.org">Future Store Initiative</a> by Metro Group. Metro Group (Metro AG) is a German global diversified retail company and wholesale/cash and carry group based in Düsseldorf. We can compare them with <a href="http://carrefour.com">Carrefour</a>, another popular retail company.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The METRO GROUP Future Store Initiative is a joint project including more than 75 partners from the retailing and consumer goods, IT and service sectors. Together, the initiative’s partners are driving forward the modernization process in the retailing sector. Each company brings something different to the project, depending on its sector and area of expertise: some make innovative technology available while others test the technology in practice. On top of that, all partners offer their expertise on managing processes more efficiently and improving services in the retailing sector. The METRO GROUP Future Store Initiative has succeeded in pooling the expertise of all its partners and using this knowledge to develop ground-breaking concepts. That makes the initiative a unique project.</p><footer><strong>Future Store Initiative</strong> <cite>METRO GROUP</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The future store is a new concepts hands on technology shop or super/hypermarket category. Its core idea may resolve new challenges that bridge between electronic commerce and ordinary dailyy life shopping. Because these days, retail industry is undergoing massive changes. So some more factors and aspects have the important role to make it better for businesses and customers. There must be also a cooperation between retail, consumer goods, information technology, service sector, and others. Some huge number of partners are taking part in developing and testing its innovative technologies and real-world concepts. Partners with various companies such as MetSAP, Intel, IBM, Cisco Systems, Fujitsu, and others to make it so.</p>

<p>What Future Store Initiative offers? What if every good technology combined together to make the ultimate commerce and retail system? We may discuss more on the realistic side rather than conceptual side.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s watch the presentational and actual videos. Or for actual readers, there&rsquo;s a white paper titled <a href="http://chainlinkresearch.com/parallaxview/whitepapers/Welcome_to_the_future_store.pdf">&ldquo;Welcome to the Future Store&rdquo; (PDF)</a>.</p>

<h1>A Virtual Tour of the Future Store</h1>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://www.wanzl.com/uploads/pics/Real_erfolgsgeschichte_FutureStore_540_web_01.jpg">http://www.wanzl.com/uploads/pics/Real_erfolgsgeschichte_FutureStore_540_web_01.jpg</a>" width="730" title="&lsquo;real,- Future Store front building&rsquo;" >
&ndash; <a href="http://wanzl.com/en_DE/company/success-stories/real-de.html">The real,- Future Store in Tönisvorst (Wanzl)</a></p>

<p>(Yes, &ldquo;real,-&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Real&rdquo; it is.)</p>

<p>This is where that advance and real implementation of ubiquitous computing mostly takes place, the advanced computing concept where computing is actually everywhere and anywhere, in contrast to desktop computing. Because it occurs with any device, location, and format. Further than that, it also takes place in customer&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, since early 2013, the Future Store Initiative has already closed. So it was mostly only tested as an experiment. So the rest is just history. Anyway, let&rsquo;s see what they have designed, developed, and achieved.</p>

<h2>Future (Things)</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a journey in the future of retailing. Notice that these technologies work together simultaneously.</p>

<h3>Mobile Shopping Assistant (MSA)</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163605_psa203m.jpg">http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163605_psa203m.jpg</a>" title="&lsquo;MSA or PSA in Tablet PC&rsquo;" >
Or Personal Shopping Assistant (PSA) is the convenient, user-friendly computer on the shopping cart.</p>

<p>What it can do and we get?</p>

<ul>
<li>Greets the customer by name.</li>
<li>Displays information and prices when the customer scans the product barcode over the built-in reading device.</li>
<li>Provides information about special offers and promotions.</li>
<li>Directs the customer to the products he needs.</li>
<li>Keeps a running total of the shopping bill.</li>
<li>Makes check-out much faster, as the customer has already scanned their purchases while shopping.</li>
<li>The data transfer process triggered from the PSA to the checkout counter automatically.</li>
<li>The receipt is printed out and the customer then pays.</li>
<li>No need to take goods out of the shopping cart and no queue.</li>
</ul>


<p>So in short, it&rsquo;s smarter to shop and reduces waiting time. In addition, the customers need a Loyalty Card to use it.</p>

<p>According to the technical specifications from numerous partner services, it has:</p>

<ul>
<li>XGA pressure-sensitive touchscreen.</li>
<li>Built-in EAN barcode scanner.</li>
<li>Long battery life.</li>
<li>Operating system with special application software by Multichannel Retail.</li>
<li>Communicates with the store’s central data server via the internal WLAN network.</li>
<li>Central data server applications, based on database.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Electronic Advertising Displays (EAD)</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6167/2089/320/FSI-Technologien_AdvertisingDisplays.jpg">http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6167/2089/320/FSI-Technologien_AdvertisingDisplays.jpg</a>" title="&lsquo;EAD in action&rsquo;" >
A dynamic display that reliable and always up-to-date. They help customers find their way around the store and latest special offers, also provide detailed information through videos or animations. They are centrally managed over the network through an internal wireless LAN connection. There&rsquo;s a chance that if it&rsquo;s presented like this, it could be more interesting.</p>

<h3>Information Terminals</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163603_infoterminal203m.jpg">http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163603_infoterminal203m.jpg</a>" title="&lsquo;Information Terminals&rsquo;" >
Or infoterminals. Like a computerized catalogs. They provide a wealth and details of information about all the products, even the manufacturing process, ingredients, and selling price. Also with additional useful household and health tips, such as recipes and tips. And obviously where to find  them.</p>

<h3>Electronic Price Labels</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/images/apr04/images/0404nsuperf2.jpg">http://spectrum.ieee.org/images/apr04/images/0404nsuperf2.jpg</a>" title="&lsquo;Electronic Price Labels&rsquo;" >
Officially called Electronic Shelf Labeling (ESL) System with digital LC displays, communicate through a separate wireless network using Communication Base Stations (CBS). So they&rsquo;re a far better accurate and always updated price labels. No this is one of the most useful and convenient way to put a price label.</p>

<h3>Intelligent Scales</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163597_scale203m.jpg">http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163597_scale203m.jpg</a>" title="&ldquo;IBM&rsquo;s Veggie Vision: Intelligent Scales&rdquo;" >
Automatically recognizes what type of food (fruit or vegetable) is being weighed, also look for the product symbol. So just place the product on the scale, then a label is automatically printed out. They&rsquo;re linked to the electronic point of sale (EPOS) controller via the store’s wireless network.</p>

<h3>Self Checkout</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/4124267/disp/dcf80744ab7bfa2ab69c471b1717e4ea.jpg">https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/4124267/disp/dcf80744ab7bfa2ab69c471b1717e4ea.jpg</a>" width="360" title="&lsquo;FastLane checkout&rsquo;" >
<img class="<a" src="href="http://kantarretailiq.eu/Content/Render/508012.jpeg">http://kantarretailiq.eu/Content/Render/508012.jpeg</a>" width="360" title="&lsquo;Self checkout&rsquo;" >
<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/Future-Store-Initiative/707414">FastLane checkout branding by Mark Magnusson</a>
and
<a href="http://kantarretailiq.eu/Conversation/ConversationDetails.aspx?id=508014">Self checkout system</a></p>

<p>Simply swipe each item over the scanner and place it in a shopping bag. Then just pay with two payment options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cash: bills or coins using the special cash terminal</li>
<li>Card: debit/credit card at the payment terminal.</li>
</ul>


<p>The details of each transaction to the store’s central POS controller, which transfers the sales data to the central Merchandise Management System (MMS).</p>

<h3>Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://plstorebrands.com/images/plmag/pli_fall2003/features/1b.jpg">http://plstorebrands.com/images/plmag/pli_fall2003/features/1b.jpg</a>" title="Employee&rsquo;s PDA" >
Not to be confused with MSA or PSA, of course. It&rsquo;s for the store employees. So they can communicate more flexibly and efficiently, access the merchandise management system, check stock levels anytime, examine each shelf to monitor expiration dates, and much more. Also yes, it&rsquo;s equipped with an RFID reader.</p>

<h3>Smart Shelves</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163601_gilette_rfidbox203.jpg">http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40163000/jpg/_40163601_gilette_rfidbox203.jpg</a>" title="&ldquo;Smart shelves with radio tags&rdquo;" >
<img class="<a" src="href="http://economists-pick-research.hktdc.com/resources/MI_Portal/Article/imn/2004/02/38561/retail089r.jpg">http://economists-pick-research.hktdc.com/resources/MI_Portal/Article/imn/2004/02/38561/retail089r.jpg</a>">
The name explains themselves.</p>

<h3>Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)</h3>

<p>RFID, RFID Reader, RFID transponder, RFID everywhere, and much more RFIDs. Almost all the above technologies and products use RFID. How it works in the context of Future Store? <a href="http://www.future-store.org/internet/site/ts_fsi/node/140064/Len/index.html">Read more in their site</a>. More into how it works can be <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/rfid.htm">read in HowStuffWorks</a>.</p>

<p>Its areas of application includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product Transport: for METRO Group Distribution Logistics (MDL)</li>
<li>Warehouse Dispatch</li>
<li>Product Delivery</li>
<li>Storage in the Backstore</li>
<li>Transporting the Goods into the Store</li>
</ul>


<h3>More (Things)</h3>

<p>There are absolutely much more features beyond those.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://kantarretailiq.eu/Content/Render/508013.jpeg">http://kantarretailiq.eu/Content/Render/508013.jpeg</a>" width="225" height="300" title="&lsquo;Roger the Robot&rsquo;" >

<li>Electronic Product Code (EPC).</li>
<li>(Serialized) Global Trade Item Number (S/GTIN).</li>
<li>Smart Freezer.</li>
<li>Logistic Unit.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>Please noted that it was developed, released or opened at circa 2003. So the interface may more represents the functional aspect with Web 2.0 design. This is the enhanced version of most common UI in the store.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/4124263/disp/5d2dc9cf66926d500bc4523d041ff0cf.jpg">https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/4124263/disp/5d2dc9cf66926d500bc4523d041ff0cf.jpg</a>" width="730" title="Common Future Store UI" >

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>In human-computer interaction aspect, there&rsquo;re a lot of things connected together and going on here. The system mostly use ubiquitous computing to manage, set, arrange, and control all the equipment and tools, where human (customers, employees, and managers) who also interact more with the technology itself  experience the better shopping and retailing process.</p>

<p>The combination of various innovative technology and services is truly a crucial factor for trade. It proven to increase efficiency in logistics and in warehouse management, whilst at the same time, giving an individual service and advanced special shopping experience for the customer.
Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}
It may actually help and boost customer with shopping experience. It&rsquo;s easier and faster to scan, list, buy, and deliver goods that actually needed. Business happy. Customer happy. But in the other hand, if it mismatched with the user&rsquo;s behavior, the experience could actually break. That&rsquo;s why the actual implementation must meet or fulfill the exact specifications and requirements. Objectively speaking, still, any advancement in innovation and technology is essentially good and useful.</p>
